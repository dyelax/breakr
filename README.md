**A simple, nonintrusive app to get you off your ass.**

Alerts you to stand up after 50 minutes of work, then waits to detect you've stopped working (no keyboard/mouse action), automatically pauses Spotify, and auto-resets when you resume

**NOTE:** To quit the app, you must use force quit. The 50-minute timer is executed with a delay, which prevents normal quitting from working.

**TODO:**
- Add iTunes/other app support
- Tweak timing for idle recognition
